    "Test Methodology\n",
    "- \"BasicEnergyBanalancePlant.slx\" was ran and temperature was sent to a time-series table in the workshop\n",
    "- A python script was ran client-side that passed through the table sending temperatures values one at a time\n",
    "- Temperature data was timestampted before sending, arrival at the cloud and return to the client\n",
    "- Using these time values a round-trip latency value can be determied \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note\n",
    "- Data was sent to Belgium server - due to lower fees\n",
    "- Inspecting data you will see times suggest data arrived at the cloud after if arrived back to the client, this is due to difference in computer clocks\n",
    "    hence, 'server_recieve_time' is invalid data and shouldn't be used\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "- Average Round Trip Latency = 0.387s (3 d.p.) \n",
    "- Given thermal inertia of battery this latency is in acceptable range by exceeding margins"
